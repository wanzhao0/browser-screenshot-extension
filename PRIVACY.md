Privacy Policy

This extension does not collect or transmit any personal user data to external servers.

- What we do: The extension captures screenshots locally in the browser and triggers a local download. All image data stays within the user's browser.
- What we don't do: We do not upload screenshots, collect browsing history, or send data to third-party servers.

If you enable optional cloud-sync features in future releases, we will clearly disclose what is sent and obtain explicit consent.
